<h1>Clara Kellermann-Bryant</h1>
<h2>OpenGL</h2>
  <p>This section pertains to the project completed for CS 330 Computational Graphics, which was developed in the spring of 2021. For this project, 
  a scene was created that contained a complex object of the Eevee pokemon, a cylinder mapped as a gluestick, a sphere mapped as a ball, two planes, and a lightsource.
  The objects were chosen items at hand to be created as a graphics demonstration. Using OpenGL and C++, this project displays my competency within graphics.</p>  
  
  <p>The challenges overcome within this project include understanding the theory behind implementing vertices, indices, VBOs, shaders, textures, and how to render objects.  
  The most concerning issues were with stitching the indices and implementing the image header to import textures where such impementation was difficult to render. 
  The indice challenges were not substantially resolved, however, the image header issues were resolved by manual import strategies to render mipmapping of the textures
  used in the project. The issues that await resolution are to be addressed in future graphics project analyses.</p>
  
  
  <h2>Initial Planning</h2>
  <p>The following photos were utilized to create a scene with complex objects and shapes within OpenGL. The objects are derived from items found within my house, 
    and I studied the forms of each object prior to implementation.</p>

  <h2>Final Scene</h2>
  <p>The last image is the execution of my scene that was created for the final project in CS 330. Through the project creation, I have gained an appreciation
    for graphics in video game applications, visualization, and embedded systems. In addition, I find this appreciation significant for the entertainment, semiconductor,
    and aerospace and defense industries.</p>
