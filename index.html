<h1>Clara Kellermann-Bryant</h1>
<h2>OpenGL</h2>
  <p>This section pertains to the project completed for CS 330 Computational Graphics, which was developed in the spring of 2021. For this project, 
  a scene was created that contained a complex object of the Eevee pokemon, a cylinder mapped as a gluestick, a sphere mapped as a ball, two planes, and a lightsource.
  The objects were chosen items at hand to be created as a graphics demonstration. Using OpenGL and C++, this project displays my competency within graphics.</p>  
  
  <p>The challenges overcome within this project include understanding the theory behind implementing vertices, indices, VBOs, shaders, textures, and how to render objects.  
  The most concerning issues were with stitching the indices and implementing the image header to import textures. </p>
